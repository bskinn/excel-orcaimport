Software Requirements
=====================

ORCA Importer has been developed and tested on Windows 7 with Excel 2010 and 2013.

It is anticipated to work smoothly with all Windows versions newer than Windows Vista,
and all versions of Excel from Office 2007 onward. Please file a
`bug report <https://github.com/bskinn/excel-orcaimport/issues>`__ if you find this
not to be the case.

Mac OSX versions of Microsoft Excel are not supported at this time.
